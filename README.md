### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer, specialized in distributed system, I am especially interested in persistent virtual worlds, and how people interact with it.
These can be a online game world, a physical simulation, or even a programming language if it provides some kind of live interactive developer experience.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m usually working on various ideas related to these topics, and can hop from one project to another to maximize learning.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and how to architect large distributed software functionally.

If you want to collaborate on some of these of topics, dont hesitate to contact me ðŸ’¬.
