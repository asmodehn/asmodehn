### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer, specialized in distributed system, I am especially interested in persistent virtual worlds, and how people interact with it.
These can be a online game world, a physical simulation, or even a programming language if it some kind of a live interactive programming experience.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m usually working on various ideas related to these topics, and can hop from one project to another to maximize learning.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning Elixir, Julia and Rust, and how to architect large distributed software functionally (and formally).

If you want to collaborate on some of these of topics, dont hesitate to contact me ðŸ’¬.

ðŸ“« Look for asmodehn on your favorite social network or ping me in here.
